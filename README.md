# TorBoxarr

Pretends to be qBittorrent or SABnzbd so your *arr apps can use [TorBox](https://torbox.app) as a download backend.

When Sonarr or Radarr sends a torrent or NZB, TorBoxarr accepts it through the standard qBittorrent/SABnzbd API, submits it to TorBox, polls until the remote download finishes, pulls the files down locally, and places them where the *arr app expects to find them.

## How it works

TorBoxarr runs a single Go binary with an HTTP server and a set of background workers. The server handles two API surfaces:

- **/api/v2/...** implements enough of the qBittorrent Web API for Sonarr/Radarr torrent integration (login, add, info, delete, categories, transfer info)
- **/api** and **/sabnzbd/api** implement enough of the SABnzbd API for usenet integration (addfile, addurl, queue, history, delete)

Behind the API, a worker pipeline processes each download through a series of states:

```
accepted -> submit_pending -> remote_queued/remote_active -> local_download_pending
-> local_downloading -> local_verify -> completed -> remove_pending -> removed
```

Each stage has its own worker loop:

1. **Submitter** sends the torrent/NZB to TorBox's API. Retries with exponential backoff on transient failures.
2. **Poller** checks TorBox for download progress. Handles the queued-to-active transition, including recovery if the queue ID disappears before an active ID appears.
3. **Downloader** fetches completed files from TorBox to local staging. Supports resumable HTTP range downloads and checkpoints progress to SQLite periodically.
4. **Finalizer** verifies all parts are on disk, then moves the staging directory to the completed path.
5. **Remover** cleans up local files when the *arr app sends a delete request.
6. **Pruner** periodically deletes old removed job records and expired qBit session tokens.

State is stored in a local SQLite database. The schema is managed with [goose](https://github.com/pressly/goose) migrations embedded in the binary.

## Setup

### Requirements

- Go 1.26+ (for building from source)
- A TorBox account with an API token
- Sonarr, Radarr, or a similar *arr application

### Configuration

TorBoxarr reads its config from environment variables. Copy the example file and fill in your credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Required variables:

| Variable | What it is |
|---|---|
| `TORBOXARR_TORBOX_API_TOKEN` | Your TorBox API token |
| `TORBOXARR_QBIT_PASSWORD` | Password for the fake qBittorrent login (you pick this, then use it in Sonarr/Radarr) |
| `TORBOXARR_SAB_API_KEY` | API key for the fake SABnzbd interface (same idea, you pick it) |

Optional overrides:

| Variable | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `TORBOXARR_SERVER_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:8085` | Base URL the server reports to clients |
| `TORBOXARR_DATA_ROOT` | `/data` | Root directory for staging, completed files, and payloads |
| `TORBOXARR_DATABASE_PATH` | `/config/torboxarr.db` | SQLite database path; the container stores state under `/config` |
| `TORBOXARR_LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Log verbosity: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, or ERROR |
| `TORBOXARR_SAB_NZB_KEY` | falls back to `TORBOXARR_SAB_API_KEY` | Explicit key for the SABnzbd-compatible endpoint; omit it to reuse the SAB API key |

Docker-specific runtime variables used by the bundled compose file. Set these to the same UID/GID that Sonarr and Radarr use on the host, so TorBoxarr can write to the same download and category folders:

| Variable | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `PUID` | none | UID the container drops to before starting TorBoxarr; required for the bundled Docker setup |
| `PGID` | none | GID the container drops to before starting TorBoxarr; required for the bundled Docker setup |

### Connecting Sonarr/Radarr / Download Clients

Set up the *arr download clients after TorBoxarr is running:

For torrent downloads, add a qBittorrent download client in Sonarr/Radarr:

- Host: wherever TorBoxarr is running
- Port: `8085`
- Username: `admin`
- Password: whatever you set in `TORBOXARR_QBIT_PASSWORD`

qBittorrent categories map to subfolders under `TORBOXARR_DATA_ROOT/completed`. If you want a new category for Sonarr or Radarr, create it in qBittorrent first or create the folder manually under the completed root before using it in SAB.

For usenet, add a SABnzbd download client:

- Host/port: same as above
- API key: whatever you set in `TORBOXARR_SAB_API_KEY`

The normal Sonarr/Radarr SABnzbd client flow will only use categories that already exist. If you need a new category, create the folder first under `TORBOXARR_DATA_ROOT/completed/<category>` or create the category through qBittorrent so TorBoxarr can discover it.

If you use a SAB category that points to a folder, make sure TorBoxarr runs with the same UID/GID as Sonarr and Radarr. Otherwise the container may not be able to create or move files into that folder.

## Running

### Docker (recommended)

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

The compose file publishes `8085:8085` on the host, bind-mounts `../data` into `/data` for downloads and payloads, creates a named Docker volume for `/config`, stores the SQLite database at `/config/torboxarr.db`, and reads `../.env` for configuration.

On startup the container runs as root briefly, recursively assigns `/config` to `PUID:PGID`, then drops privileges and starts TorBoxarr as that user. This makes named-volume `/config` setups work without manual `chown`.

The automatic ownership repair only applies to `/config`. `../data` is left untouched, so you should still make sure your downloads/media path is writable by the same UID/GID if you expect shared write access with Sonarr, Radarr, or other tools.

If you choose Docker's `user:` setting instead, the container starts directly as that user and skips the built-in ownership repair. In that mode `/config` must already be writable or the container will exit early with a clear startup error.

### From source

```bash
go build -o bin/torboxarr ./cmd/torboxarr
./bin/torboxarr
```

Direct binary runs default to `/config/torboxarr.db`. If you want a different path for local development, set `TORBOXARR_DATABASE_PATH`.

The binary runs database migrations automatically on startup, so you don't need to run goose separately unless you want to manage migrations by hand:

```bash
goose -dir internal/store/migrations sqlite3 /config/torboxarr.db up
```

## Development

gofmt -w ./cmd ./internal
